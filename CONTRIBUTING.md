# Contribution Guidelines

> Please be aware that I want to accept your contribution, but I have **some rules to keep what I think it's good quality** of the packages listed here. **Sorry if I can't meet your expectations, I do my best**.

- **To add, remove, or change things on the list** please submit a pull request

awesome-pubdev is a specially curated list for high-quality, actively maintained Pub.dev packages and resources.

- List items must be sorted *alphabetically*;
- Categories must be sorted *alphabetically*;
- Each item should be limited to one link;
- The link should be the name of the package;
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional. Often a good description is the one found in the metadata field on the pub.dev website;
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line and end with a punctuation mark;
- At least 3 items are needed to create a new category;
- The package or project had to be maintained under **open source license**, [see list of allowed licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical).

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.

## Pull Request

To allow me to more easily check your pull requests, here are some indications:
 
- Open one pull request for one package addition;
- If you want to add more packages at a time, put packages belonging to the same category within the same pull request;
- Do not add multiple packages belonging to different categories to the same pull request;
- If you want to create a pull request for a new category, create both the menu item and the corresponding category. I remember that to create a category there must be at least 3 packages;

## Quality standards

To be on the list, project repositories should adhere to these quality standards:

- Code functions as documented and expected
- Generally useful to the wider community of Flutter or Dart programmers
- Actively maintained
  - Regular, recent commits
  - Or, for finished projects, issues and pull requests are responded to
- Stable or progressing toward stable
- Thoroughly documented (README) in english language, so everyone is able to understand the project's intention and how it works

## Maintainer

I will review your PR and notify you and tag it in case any information is still missing. I will wait 15 days for your interaction, after that the PR will be closed.

## Reporting issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. I realize sometimes packages fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of time, so if you see that, feel free to change its listing or let me know. I also realize that sometimes package are just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature. These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental.

Thanks everyone!
